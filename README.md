# learn-discord-bots-python-1
Introduction

The first in a series to document my path to applying Python knowledge and understanding towards something practical. Feel free to follow along and implement these bots in a Discord server.

This Discord Bot, programmed with Python, will post a message (application side) that it is ready once the script is run. The Bot will also reply to messages with a simple text reply.

Needed:
Python 3.10.2
Discord
Discord Bot account created through Developer Portal
